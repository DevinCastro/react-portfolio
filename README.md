#React Portfolio


App deployed at: http://DevinCastro.github.io/react-portfolio

### Description:
>This is my personal web developer portfolio create with react.  Here you can find my professional portfolio of my recent projects that I made.  On the portfolio page you can find all the information about these projects as well as their links to deployed apps, links to repos, and a screenshot of the application.   

## Technologies Used:
This is a React application made with create-react-app.  This portfolio is strictly just front end.  I am using the react router to switch between pages.  And I build a single 'project' component to dynamically render each project with the same code.  

## Usage:
Upon landing on the home page, you can see my name along with two clickable icons to my linkedin and my GitHub accounts.  The nav bar at the top will take you to my portfolio page or contact page.  The portfolio page had clickable buttons to take you to the application repo or deployed version.  The footer at the bottom on all pages will take you to my Github, Linkedin or my resume.
